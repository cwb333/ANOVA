# ANOVA
This is a shiny app to perform analysis of variance and Tukey's honestly significant differences test.  For the app to run correctly, the dependent numeric variable should be the first column in the data set.  The remaining columns should be categorical variables.  This app can handle up to a five way ANOVA.
